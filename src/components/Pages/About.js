Where do Food Hero recipes come from?
Recipes that make it to Food Hero have had a long journey getting there.  Most of the recipes have been used by our
 nutrition educators in the field and then submitted to the Food Hero team to be considered for the website.  
 Recipes have the criteria found at this link: https://foodhero.org/recipe-criteria. 
</p>
<p>
 All recipes go through testing.  In addition to being tested for overall flavor, color, 
and texture we look for recipes that have low-cost and easy to find ingredients, easy to follow instructions,
 and a reasonable preparation time.  Each recipe is tasted and rated by several people.  After being tested a recipe 
 either passes through this step as it was submitted, is revised and then retested, or once in a while is deemed unusable for Food Hero.</p>
<p>
Once a recipe makes it through testing we use a computer program to create a nutrition facts label and check that the
 recipe in its final form meets our nutrition program criteria.  Serving sizes for nutrition analysis are based on FDA serving sizes.</p>
<p>
Once a recipe is posted on FoodHero.org we monitor user comments and comments from our 100+ educators who use the
 recipe in the field.  We edit recipes often based on comments.  Such as adding in great ideas educators have for ingredient substitutions.

<p>
One of the features in the top right-hand corner of the recipe section is the ability to sort or

<h3>What is our mission?</h3>
